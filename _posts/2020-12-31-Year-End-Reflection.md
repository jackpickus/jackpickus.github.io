How was 2020?

Horrible, haha just kidding. It was actually going pretty well until mid-March when everyone went home
for Spring break. This year has been unique to say the least and I think the biggest lesson I can take
away from all of this is, be thankful for what you have. I graduated from college, I played over 30 rounds of golf, started my first job, and
everyone I know has been safe and healthy. 

The best part about this whole pandemic is, it has allowed me to focus on my identity, who I want to be.
If life was how it was before quarantine, I probably wouldn't have placed as much focus on developing it.
I bet I'd still just be happy to be here and simply looking to meet the minimum in everything I do, rather than focusing on reading books, playing guitar, and learning about
new tech; all the while improving myself. The reprioritizing has been tough. There are days when everything sucks cause I can't interact with other
humans, but even in this short period of time, I feel like I've already improved and leveled up to a better me. 

> Life is work, work is life

I hope to continue these habits and achieve more balance in everything
I do once we get back to normal, because face to face interactions and mass gatherings are still fun even if we can't do them right now. Balance is
what allows us to achieve
a happy and fulfilling life. This is why habits matter, priorities matter, and why balancing
*everything* is so darn difficult. Life is work, work is life, is what my favorite CS professor would say when
he would talk about a tough assignment or when everyone was preparing for the final. That phrase is simple but it
holds so much truth when you think about it. Thus, I will leave 2020 at that,
nothing is easy because if it were, what would be the point of surviving and thriving in today's world.
