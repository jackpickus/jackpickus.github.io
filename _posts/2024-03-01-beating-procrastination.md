You are your own worst enemy

I was listening to an audio book last week and one of the chapters was all about procrastination.
This resesonated with me tremendously because I am a chronic procrasinator.
I learned that I put off doing whatever task needs to be done as a way to change my mood. I don't want to 
complete the work so I'll do something else and for the time being I'm happy. In the long run, I end up with
less time, more stress and the feeling of regret. "Why didn't I start sooner? I had so much time beforehand, now I have none." 
I hate to admit it, but I've asked myself that countless times. I only have myself to blame.
I'm sure many others have experienced something very similar and if you're a programmer then you 100% have.

The purpose of this post is to share some of the techniques I learned and currently use to beat procrastination and get more done.

### 1. Start Now
Whatever the task may be, start it now! Don't wait thirty minutes or after just one more YouTube video. Do it now
because starting is the hardest part. It's easy to continue kicking the can down the road. You can make more excuses
and the task remains off in the distance rather than in your face causing stress and unhappiness. However, these are merely
lies you tell yourself to alter your mood and make you feel good. Do not wait, getting going now.

I recommend you sit down and set a timer for a twenty-five minutes. Look at the task at hand and start working on it. Usually
I find the work to be a lot less worse than I made it out to be in my head. If twenty-five is too long then do ten or 
even five minutes.  The important part is you are working. After the timer is up, take a short five minute break. This is not a new
idea, it's called the pomodoro technique and I highly recommend it. I use it especially when I'm sturggling to start a task. I'll set
a goal of X amount of 25 minute work intervals (pomodoros) and begin working. That way even if I feel completely lost or hopeless with
the work, at least I am putting in time and effort. 


### 2. Break It Down
This a very simple idea, not that any of these three thoughts are complex but break the task down into small bite size chunks.
I like to create a list of all the tasks I need to do for a project. Then order them in importance and only move on to the next task
once the previous one is completed. That way the large amount of work appears to be smaller. Rather than simply say, "I'm going to create
a website." Create a checklist of all the things you need to do to create that site. The first item may be, create the `index.html` file
and then the `styles.css`. If you don't know what to do then you better be searching the internet until you find something, anything that
can help guide you. The internet is a beautiful thing especially when you're a programmer.

### 3. Bet On It
The last idea, is make a bet with someone. If you want to complete dry January but know you'll cave halfway through,
bet someone $100 or whatever amount money you'd hate to lose and I guarentee you'll be sober for 31 days.
Now Dry January has nothing to do with procrastinating, so a better example is say you're not working on your
side projects as much as you'd like to. Make a bet that you'll commit X amount of git commits each day. I personally
made that very bet, one commit a day on my side project in the month of December 2023. Some days I did the bare
minimum but most days I went beyond one because I had gained so much momentum and progress which coincides with the
idea from Start Now. Objects in motion tend to stay in motion. If you're struggling to find the energy and motivation
to do something, money can be an excellent way to get you going.

### Conclusion
I hope these three ideas help you and maybe even gave you some new thoughts on how to beat procrastination.
