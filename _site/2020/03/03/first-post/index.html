    <p>Why start blogging?</p>

<p>I have decided to start blogging in order to reflect on what I’ve learned as
a Gen Zer. I have been a student my entire life and will probably be one forever.
We never stop learning and realizing that we know so little about the world.
Please keep in mind that this post and future posts are based soley off of what
I’ve read, watched, and experienced. That is one of the
beauties of blogging, I can write and share whatever I want. For this post I
want to explore what it means to be wise and have “experience.”</p>

<p>When I was an undergrad, I was told by one of my favorite professors
that wisdom is not simply obtained
through experience. Rather he stated, it is experience <em>plus</em> thinking about
it, could one obtain wisdom. Reflecting about what had
occurred is important because
how can one learn if they don’t take the time to think afterwards.
I believe one learns best by doing
but if they never stop and take the time to consider what exactly they’re doing,
they may never full understand the experience.</p>

<p>Reflecting can be done a number of 
ways, two easy ones are talking and journaling. Both techniques allow one to share their feelings and
get a better scope of the situation since it is after the fact. This works because
it forces one to think at a deeper level. You have a lot of life experience and if
you write about those memories, you can expand on them since you are reflecting
at a different point in time. After all, we are constantly learning and searching
for knowledge, a reflection period allows for that to occur.
In turn helping one become all the more wiser because they can now use
the experience and their newly found knowledge in the future.</p>

<p>As I continue my journey into adulthood and the “real world,” reflecting on
life seems like a health way to cope with the ever increasing connected world.
That way I may find some wisdom but who knows, I’m sure in a couple years
I’ll look back and say this post was terrible. However I do plan on using this
blog to reflect with the hopes
that I can lead a more thoughtful and meaningful life.</p>
