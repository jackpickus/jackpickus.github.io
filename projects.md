I have realized that the best way to learn is by doing. Here you can find a list of all
projects, big or small, that I have made. Of course all of my code is uploaded to
Github and for further descriptions please feel free to visit my Github page to learn more.

### React Weather App
A weather application used with the Create React App and the OpenWeatherMap API.
One can enter in a location and receive a 5 day forecast for said location.

### HangMan
A simple hangman game made with HTML and JavaScript with a little bit of styling.
